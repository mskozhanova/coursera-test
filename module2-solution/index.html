		  	<p>My sister's name is Evgenia Semyonova. She  creates a unique soutache embroidered jewelry. Having fallen in love with this technique some years ago she's happy to find her own style in it. This is not only a hobby, but a passion for her.</p>
		  	<p>She lives in a beautiful  city of Vladivostok (Russia) by the Japan sea. The sea is hery everyday companion, so it made a great deal in her art. </p>

			<p><i>"Soutache embroidery is a magic tool in the hands of a skilled craftsman. The sketch helps me to start, and then the piece itself leads my hands hinting the ornament.</i></p>
			<p><i>I studied Chinese and English, but I always tended to express myself through the art. I love music, I sing and write my own songs.   All this is due to my parents, especially to my Dad. He has a fastidious taste in art which influented much for my artisic growing-up. He always gives me a valuable advice. "</i></p>
